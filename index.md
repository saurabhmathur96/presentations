neural networks and their application to Computer Vision. (<a href="./NeuralNetworks/Neural Networks Links.pdf">A list of short videos that inspired this talk</a>)
- <a href="./LearningTheory/Size-Independent Sample Complexity of Neural Networks.pdf">Size-Independent Sample Complexity of Neural Networks</a>: Presentation on a paper where the authors propose a tighter bound on generarlization error or Neural Networks
- <a href="./CVLab/Learning Depth from Single Monocular Images.pdf">Learning Depth from Single Monocular Images</a>: Presentation on a paper from 2005 on estimating pixel-wise depth from single-view 2D images using a Probabilistic Graphical Model.
- <a href="./CVLab/slides.pdf">Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks</a>: Presentation on a paper that studies practical considerations for training deep neural networks.
